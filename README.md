# Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5 for Customer Complaint Analysis

## Overview
A company, providing internet, television, and phone services, is focused on improving customer satisfaction. The company receives a high volume of daily inquiries and complaints, making it crucial to analyze customer feedback efficiently.

This project aims to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model using Python and the OpenAI API to extract key details from customer complaints, including:
- **Complaint Topic**
- **Identified Problem**
- **Customer Dissatisfaction Index** (ranging from 0 to 100)

The fine-tuned model will process complaints in real-time to help PulseNet address customer concerns effectively.
